## Sleep Efficiency Prediction using a Feed-Forward Neural Network
This project predicts sleep efficiency based on various factors, including age, sleep duration, REM sleep percentage, and lifestyle habits. The model is implemented as a feed-forward neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains several features related to sleep patterns, demographics, and lifestyle. Each row represents an individual's sleep data, including the following key features:

Age: The age of the individual.
Gender: Gender of the individual.
Sleep Duration: Number of hours spent sleeping.
REM Sleep Percentage: Percentage of sleep spent in REM.
Deep Sleep Percentage: Percentage of sleep spent in deep sleep.
Light Sleep Percentage: Percentage of sleep spent in light sleep.
Awakenings: Number of times the individual woke up during the night.
Caffeine Consumption: Amount of caffeine consumed.
Alcohol Consumption: Amount of alcohol consumed.
Smoking Status: Whether the individual smokes.
Exercise Frequency: Frequency of exercise.
The target variable is Sleep Efficiency, which measures how efficiently the individual sleeps.

# Dataset Source
You can find various sleep datasets on platforms like Kaggle or Hugging Face Datasets. Alternatively, you can upload a compatible dataset directly for this project.

# Model Architecture
The model is a simple feed-forward neural network with the following structure:

Input Layer: Receives multiple input features from the dataset.
Hidden Layer 1: A dense layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation.
Hidden Layer 2: A dense layer with 32 neurons and ReLU activation.
Output Layer: A single neuron for predicting sleep efficiency (as this is a regression task).
The loss function used is mean squared error (MSE), and the optimizer used is Adam with a learning rate of 0.001.

# Code Structure and Usage
The project is organized into modules for easy use and reusability:

 1. dataset_module.py
This module contains the load_and_preprocess_data function, which handles data loading, preprocessing, and scaling.

2. model_module.py
This module contains the NeuralNetworkModel class, which defines the neural network structure, training, and evaluation methods.

3. Jupyter Notebook (Sleep_Efficiency_Prediction_Notebook.ipynb)
This notebook demonstrates how to use the modules to load data, initialize the model, train, and evaluate it.

## Instructions for Running the Code
